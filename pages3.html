  <h1 class="PagesTitle">Legalizing Undocumented Immigrants</h1>
  <p class="PagesContent">

	Undocumented immigrants are in the wrong both legally and morally.
	</p>
	<p class="PagesContent">

	“If you are under my roof, you gotta play by my rules.” The rules of a country are called laws. The laws of the United States of America declare that undocumented immigrants are illegal. ILLEGAL, as in “breaking the law”, as in “ murder is illegal”, or in “stealing from a blind old lady is illegal”. That’s the law of this land, you don’t have to like it, you can walk away —or, for those who are not on this land to begin with, you can simply not come here. Yes, in this country, the right to pursue happiness is guaranteed, but the success of such pursuit is not. If you are to say that the pursuit of happiness can exempt law-breaking, it would be as ridiculous as saying that one’s killing one’s boss would be legal, because one would be made happier with boss’s cease of existence, or one’s stealing from the blind lady would be legal  if one would be happier with more money. Some might argue that crossing the border without proper documentation is more justifiable, less illegal, than murder or robbery. Even if they were right, —even if they are so confident in their excuse for breaking the law,  they should fight for it through the legal system.  Why not stand your ground in court? Why not sue the government, and appeal (if they would lose). If the answer is that the legal system is not good enough, do you honestly think that continuously and intentionally  breaking the law is the correct first step towards fixing it?

	Now, you moral highlanders who think yourselves too nice, too kind, and too righteous to be bounded by the law — you must agree that all human beings deserve equal human rights, and a part of those rights include happiness(or at least the chance to fight for happiness.). You must also agree that everyone is equal and deserves, equally, their own opinions. Now as the definition of moral is subjective, you have to agree that everyone deserves, equally, their own opinions on what is moral and what is not. This chain of logic leads us to the conclusion that everyone is entitled to their own definition of morality. Therefore, if we are to ignore the existence(and breaking) of laws, if illegal immigrants can come into this country in pursuit of their happiness because such action is allowed by their(or yours) moral code, a miserable employee should also feel free to kill his boss in pursuit of his happiness, if such action is allowed by his moral code. You might disagree with his moral code, but in the spirit of equality and diversity, it should hold the same weight as yours.

	 Now you might argue that you are, in fact, morally superior than the murderer am because justice is on your side and not his. Yes, murderers are condemnable because their pursuits of happiness have hurt the happiness of others. But do you honestly believe that numerous undocumented immigrants crowding into this country wouldn’t harm any others? If it wouldn’t, why not invite every unhappy soul on earth to come to America —every refugee, every political victim, every …? Are you ok with a homeless man sneaking into your house, eat your food, sleep on your bed and stay for eternity. If you are, how about two? ten? a million? Do you welcome absolutely everyone? murderers? child rapist? fascists? Where you draw the line? In fact, you cannot draw any lines —because any rules(laws) you impose will be broken by anyone whose moral codes allow them to break rules.

	If you are ok with countless random people from all paths of life breaking into your house uninvited and staying as long as they want, by all means, support undocumented immigrants. And by the way, please tell me the address of your home, because I’d loved to drop by too.
